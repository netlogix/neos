`BUGFIX: Discard selected nodes which were moved corrupts workspace <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/756>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "discard selected nodes" feature in the Workspace Review module
leaves orphaned nodes after discarding moved document nodes. The result
is a seemingly empty workspace which in fact still contains nodes.
The workspace can't be deleted. The discarded document node still may
appear in the Content Module's navigation but won't render.

Steps to reproduce based on the Neos demo site:

- start with a clean user workspace
- move the page Download into the page Try me
- go to the review module (Publish Menu -> Review changes)
- select all changes
- press "Discard selected changes"

The document node has been removed, but the child nodes, including the
corresponding shadow nodes, still exist in the database.

Closes #953

`BUGFIX: Unpublished new nodes still have shadow nodes after removal <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/1167>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When an editor creates a new page and then deletes the page again,
the workspace module will show pending changes because shadow nodes
exist for that delete page. Because the page has never been published,
Neos should just really delete the respective nodes from the user's
workspace instead of creating shadow nodes.

This change checks if a node marked for removal exists at all in one
of the base workspaces and if it doesn't, removes it completely instead
of creating a shadow node.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When clicking the delete site button in the sites administration module's edit view, the following buttons jump a little due to overflow issues. This is circumvented by moving the dialog html outside of the footer.
